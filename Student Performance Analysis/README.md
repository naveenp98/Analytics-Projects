# Student Performance Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a CSV file of exam scores and other information for students. 
What are some insights that can be generated? 
Can exam scores be explained using the provided data effectively?

## Executive Summary
The goal was to generate a few visuals and insights from the data to answer the question of whether exam scores can be explained using the provided data effectively.
The dataset contains 20 columns and 6607 records, each record representing a student.
7 numerical columns and 13 categorical columns, with a few categorical columns have missing data.

After exploring the ket statistics of the data, a regression model was developed to try and explain what exam scores were dependent on, and to what degree.

The results included key correlations of certain quantitative variables on exam score such as attendance, tutoring sessions and hours studied. It also outlined the importance of qualtiative variables, especially access to resources, parental involvement, family income and motivation.

With this, the best course of action is to 
- Provide study-only periods, additional tutoring sessions and incentivize regular attendance.
- Conduct regular Parent-Teacher conferences
- Incentivize higher exam scores 
- Provide easier access to books, stationery etc.
