# Does Suited's Algorithm work?

Suited is an A.I. powered, assessment-driven recruiting network that enables professional services firms to accurately, confidently, and equitably discover early career candidates.

## Problem Statement
Imagine that you are in the role of Data Analyst, Insights at Suited. We have a client that
provided us with hiring data on recent applicants and asks "is the algorithm working?" and
“what is a good score?”

## Executive Summary
The dataset consisted of 2 seperate sheets that had information on candidates; one from Suited and one from the Client. These datasets captured essential information like name, school, gpa etc.

Since data collection was different across the two datasets, both sheets' data was cleaned so merging would be smooth. This involved changing school names to standardize them.

After joining the datasets, analysis was conducted to understand the type of applicants that were highered. The Suited assessment scores were looked into and a number of insights were unearthed.

The final set of analysis is present in the Answers folder.
